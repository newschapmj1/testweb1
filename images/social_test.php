<h3 class="text-center">Coach Assisted Walking Holiday - the Minster Way <br>
2nd – 7th September 2017</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minster_Way">The Minster Way</a> – A fifty mile walk between The Minsters of Beverley and York. The group will stay in the York Hostel
although members may book their own B&amp;B accommodation. The cost for those staying at the hostel, full board, will be about £350 or £150 for those booking their own B&B. This is based on about 20 people taking part. With 30 participants the cost would be about £300 and £100 respectively - even lower if more take part. At the hostel there will be a few two-bed rooms, possibly at an extra charge.</P>
<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="images/8272060019_1bd388d31c_z_edited.jpg" alt="signpost">

    Canary Wharf.</p>

    <p>I have acquired fifty tickets for this round trip. Please book your place now to avoid
    disappointment as the places are taken up quickly.
    On the return journey you’ll enjoy the bright lights of London and see the Tower Bridge, all lit
    up, open as you pass under it.</p>
